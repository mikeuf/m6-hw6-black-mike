I used StackOverflow, GetBootStrap and W3schools for this assignment. Some of the basic starter HTML was reused from an earlier homework assignment.

I ran into a couple of vexing issues:
1. I used the flex classes for Bootstrap 4. Although they are actually easier once you get used to them, I struggled a bit with things like getting square buttons and having the columns wrap properly at smaller sizes.
2. When adding a child element, I couldn't figure out how to add it as a child to the outer div, which felt for natural. In the end, as a workaround, I just assigned an id to the inner div and then append to that instead.
